# Qlipper

Qlipper is a moderately fast implementation of my solar sail guidance law, QUAIL, developed for my 4th year undergraduate thesis in aerospace engineering.

Extending the research done during my undergrad thesis to greater heights using a more robustly written and well-developed simulator.

Qlipper also represents my quest to learn JAX and make an autograd-based implementation of the Q-Law, as a spiritual successor to [Star Sailor](https://github.com/itchono/star-sailor).

## Project Plans

* Milestone 1: Mirrored implementation of existing [SLyGA](https://github.com/itchono/SLyGA) repository, except all in Python
* Milestone 2: Getting autograd and jit to work so code becomes fast
* Milestone 3: Expansion of the Q-Law to include 6-element static targeting
* Milestone 4: Multibody transfers

## Infrastructure

* Unit tests are important, so those will be added
